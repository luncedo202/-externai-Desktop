# Build and Release Workflow
# This workflow builds and publishes releases for ExternAI Desktop application
# 
# Permissions: This workflow requires write access to create releases and publish packages.
# The workflow uses GITHUB_TOKEN by default. To use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead,
# create a secret named RELEASE_PAT with appropriate permissions and uncomment the relevant
# lines in the Publish step.
#
# Triggers: Only runs on version tag pushes (v*.*.*) or manual workflow dispatch to prevent
# accidental releases from forks or pull requests.
