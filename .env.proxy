# Proxy Server Configuration
# Update this with your deployed proxy server URL

# For development (local proxy server)
PROXY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For production (use your deployed Railway/Render URL)
# PROXY_SERVER_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Or use environment variable
# The app will use this URL to make API calls instead of calling Claude directly
